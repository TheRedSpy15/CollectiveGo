# CollectiveGo
## 14 news sources in one!

**More Detail.**
CollectiveGo gives you 14 different news sites to read articles from. You can pick which article to either view or download.

**How?**
Through RSS feeds, which contain the link to each article. That link is then used by colly to scrape text and display it through CLI.

**Download?**
Currently, there is no compile executable published. However, if you have Go installed, you can build it with instructions below.

**Build from source (requires Go installed)**
